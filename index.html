      <p class="lede">Words cannot express our excitement to host our friends and family in Chicago to celebrate our
      big day.
      We are so eternally grateful to every single one of you and how supportive you have all been as we have been on this adventure together. Please come back and visit as we will be continuously updating this site with the details as we get closer to our wedding.</p>

      <p class="lede">If I could order the perfect guy from a catelog, he still wouldn't compare to <strong>Shane</strong>. I'm so happy to be on this adventure called life together.</p>
      <p>While celebrating our engagement together one of my close friends stated,
      <blockquote>"When we graduated college I would have told you that Lauren would be the last of us to get married. When I met Shane, I knew she'd be the first."</blockquote></p>
      <p>Shane has the biggest heart in the world. He not only supports me in everything I do, but constantly pushes me to be better. I could not have gotten luckier.</p>
      <p>I am so excited to spend the rest of my life as an adventure with this man.</p>

      <p class="lede"><strong>Lauren</strong> pushes me every single day to be the best version of myself I can be</p>
      <p>I could not have asked for a better partner in her. She is someone who knows my true desires, fears, thoughts, and intracacies. Without her, I don't feel I could truly be myself.</p>
      <p>I will rest easy knowing I found the other half of me, I didn't even know I was missing.</p>
