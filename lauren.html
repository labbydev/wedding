      <p>While living and working in D.C. Lauren met Shane, the love of her life. After dating for a year they moved in together and got a large, lazy and very loving goldendoodle named Hodor. Over the course of their relationship Lauren and Shane have travelled all over together from raod trips to visit family, to private getaways in Canada. When Lauren's career offered her a better job opportunity in Chicago, Shane's employer was gracious enough to allow him to work full-time as a remote employee, so they both moved there together.</p>
      <p>Currently, Lauren works as a Senior Front-End Developer for a small family-owned web development firm in Chicago. There she acts as a technical lead on a wide variety of Open Source web projects for higher education and commercial brands. Lauren has been all over the country to attend and even speak at web development conferences, and is actively interested in both learning from and mentoring others in her field.</p>
      <p>In her spare time, Lauren enjoys dabbling in digital photography, cheering on the Cincinnati Bengals, hanging out with her dog, and discovering new things to do in Chicago. One of her favorite things to do is to take Hodor to the dog beach.</p>
