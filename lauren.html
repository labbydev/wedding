      <p>As a child she was an active Girl Scout, which is how she met her Matron of Honor, Robyn. Lauren was actually an active girl scout for almost twelve years, even earning her Girl Scout Gold Award. Throughout high school, she was also a writer and Entertainment Editor of the Lakota East High School newsmagazine, Spark. She attended multiple journalism conferences and even spent a few weeks in Dallas over the summer working on her writing skills.</p>
      <p>After high school she attended Ohio University in Athens, Ohio. At OU, Lauren participated in multiple extra curricular activities including being a Web Editor for a campus magazine, Backdrop and Development Lead on the 2015 Soul of Athens web projects. She was an active member of the Delta Zeta Sorority, where she met her Bridesmaids Erika and Lauren. Over her four years at OU she managed to earn two Bachelor's degrees: BS in Journalism, and BS in Visual Communications. After college, Lauren moved to Washington D.C. to pursue a career in web development.</p>

      <p>While living and working in D.C. Lauren met Shane, the love of her life. After dating for a year they moved in together and got a large, lazy and very loving goldendoodle named Hodor. Over the course of their relationship Lauren and Shane have travelled all over together from raod trips to visit family, to private getaways in Canada. When Lauren's career offered her a better job opportunity in Chicago, Shane's employer was gracious enough to allow him to work full-time as a remote employee, so they both moved there together.</p>
      <p>Currently, Lauren works as a Senior Front-End Developer for a small family-owned web development firm in Chicago. There she acts as a technical lead on a wide variety of Open Source web projects for higher education and commercial brands. Lauren has been all over the country to attend and even speak at web development conferences, and is actively interested in both learning from and mentoring others in her field.</p>
      <p>In her spare time, Lauren enjoys dabbling in digital photography, cheering on the Cincinnati Bengals, hanging out with her dog, and discovering new things to do in Chicago. One of her favorite things to do is to take Hodor to the dog beach.</p>
