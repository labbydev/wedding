        <h2>David Shane Burroughs</h2>
        <div class="l-66">
            <p>Shane was born and raised in the Hollywood, Maryland area (about two hours south of Washington, D.C.).
                Shane is an older brother to his sister Brianna. His Parents Jane and David have been happily married
                for over 25 years.
            </p>
            <p>Growing up Shane was hooked to technology and video games like any male child growing up in the early
                90s. Shane attended Kindergarten through eigth grade at St. Johns School where he met childhood friend
                Ryan Cease. Shane played football for 5 years, 4 of which were at his high school Leonardtown High. His
                freshman year, through football and the weight room, he met his longtime friends Bryan Wood and Alex
                Walters. Shane frequently found himself in his free time playing computer games with large groups of
                friends, including Tyler Clark.
            </p>
            <p>Post high school, Shane attended college while working for his fathers concrete finishing company. He
                attended University of Maryland University College where he he spent three years completing his
                Bachelors of Science in Computer Science with a minor in Computing. Shane has held several positions in
                IT, most of which have been as a software engineer. He is currently working as a software engineer from
                a home office in Chicago, IL.
            </p>
            <p>Shane is a diehard redskins fan who attends as many games as he possibly can. When the Redskins aren't
                doing so hot, he likes to play fantasy football for fun. Despite being away from his family home, he is
                elated at how much he has come to love Chicago. He is very excited to explore everything Chicago has to
                offer and hopefully find a home where he and Lauren can build their future together.
